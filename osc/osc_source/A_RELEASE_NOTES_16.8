 web pages :
 ---------
  The first thing to note is that with the 16.8 we come with a strong revision
 of the web pages. Now the pages present themselves as tutorial and "how to"
 to quickly start the various programs. In particular all considerations about
 architectures (and sociology) which are more internal things had been casted
 at the end of the pages (if not suppressed !).

 Geant4 :
 ------
  The osc_vis kits come now with the material to have quickly high level GUI
 and visualization to work with Geant4. (A direct consequence of the
 2008 Geant4 Annecy school). (In fact the 16.8 release could be named
 the "Annecy" release :-) ) It had been long to find the right way to do that
 but we have the conviction to be now "on track" with this problem. 
 To do that we have introduced a new program : osc-g4-vis. The osc-g4-vis
 program permits to instrument automatically some of the Geant4 examples
 (novice, A01, TestEm1) and, by code cloning, someone can quickly have
 the same working with its Geant4 program.

  We get rid of the idea of having the osc_g4 kit that embarqued CLEHP
 and Geant4. Clearly people prefer to install themselves CLHEP and Geant4
 outside OpenScientist. Now Geant4 is considered as a "driver" of an osc_vis
 kit in the same way that CERNLIB is a driver to a osc_batch kit and that
 gtk, Qt, Python are drivers too of an osc_vis kit. In particular if building
 from source there is now a "-group Geant4" that builds the code related
 to Geant4 (in fact only the G4Lab package) (Then CLHEP and Geant4 are
 considered "foreign" according the obuild terminology).

  As for all the other drivers related to a foreign package, if installing
 a osc_vis binary kit, you must check the binary compatibilty of your installed CLHEP and Geant4 versus what comes with the kit. (The 16.8 kits had been built with CLHEP-2.0.3.2 and Geant4-9.1.p02).

 Naming of programs :
 ------------------
  We have converged also about the naming of programs. (A long story too).
 It is clear that the namespace "osc" imposed itself now. The program
 osc-plot replaces onxlab, osc-gui-viewer replaces onx and osc-paw replaces
 opaw. osc-config replaces onx-config and suppersed all the other various
 xxx-config.

  Now there is six main programs : osc-plot, osc-gui-viewer, osc-gui-server,
 osc-g4-vis, osc-paw, osc-config. And the pages had been strongly revisited
 to concentrate on the usage of them.

 The osc-server :
 --------------
  The osc-gui-server is the first version of a "GUI server". The idea here
 is to have on your local computer a "super X11" server to which someone
 can send the whole GUI of an appliction. and also graphics scene graphs.
 With that you can run on a remote machine a client that will send to the
 GUI server the GUI specifications (in fact the .onx XML files) but will
 do also some physics and then build some graphics scene graphs that it
 can send also to the super server for visualization. As the callbacks
 are scripted then a click on a local computer GUI button send back the
 script to the client. The client then executes it on its remote machine.
 All this is possible in an easy way because in OpenScientist the GUIs are
 described in XML files but also because we have file format for the graphics
 too (for graphics the client send compressed Inventor file to the server).

 AIDA :
 ----
  The 16.8 is still on AIDA-3.2.1. And the "AIDA environment" like
 the various aida-setup and the aida-config program are still here.

  Note anyway that there is now the new "FS" AIDA::ITree type that
 permits at commit/write of the tree to map the tree hierarchy to
 an equivalent hierarchy on the file system. A "leaf" data being
 then written into a file in the FS directory.

 Else :
 ----
  Else there is a lot of internal modifications that we are not going
 to exhaust ourselves to describe here because most of people... don't
 care of them ! :-)
