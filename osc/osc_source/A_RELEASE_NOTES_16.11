 Snow Leopard :
 ------------
  The main feature of this release is to have done
 modifications to run on Mac Snow Leopard. Most of drivers
 are here on this platform except the BatchLab/Zebra
 because we have not the CERNLIB for Mac 64 bits.

 Cocoa :
 -----
  We have restore the "NextStep" drivers that permits
 to use Cocoa directly on a Mac.
 By default now, on a Mac, OnX builds the GUI by using Cocoa.
 Then Motif is no more mendatory on this platform.
 Then the osc-plot.app application uses Cocoa now. Someone
 has to use osc-plot-Xt.app to run the Motif version.
 On a Mac we have used "foreign" packages installed by Darwinport
 (then under /opt) and no more by using Fink.

 Linux / gtk2 :
 ------------
  On a Linux, the default GUI toolkit (for osc-gui-viewer,
 osc-plot, etc...) is now gtk-2 and no more OpenMotif.
 This seems more natural since gtk is the GUI toolkit of GNU.
 This simplify the default build since gtk-2 is found at
 a standard place on all Linuxes (which is not the case
 of Qt4). We have introduced the gtkglarea package. It appeared
 that gtkglarea is not defacto installed on Linuxes, then 
 having it coming with the source kits simplify a local
 build and installation.

 Motif :
 -----
  Then Motif is no more mendatory by default. The default
 GUIs are now :
 - Cocoa on a Mac.
 - gtk-2 on Linuxes.
 - WIN32 on Windows.
  But the Xt/Motif code is still here and you can build
 it with :
     build -group Xt
  At run time, to have Motif as GUI for osc-plot do :
     osc-plot -Xt
  You can also change the GUI toolkit by setting the
 OSC_GUI_TOOLKIT environment variable to Xt and running
 osc-plot without the -Xt argument.

 Qt-4 :
 ----
  We have get rid of the Qt4 code. And we do not need
 anymore the "Qt3Support" to build the Qt drivers.

 G4Lab :
 -----
  osc-g4-vis produce the build_Darwin_app shell script
 that permit to build a clickable ".app" for a G4 example.

 Rio :
 ---
  Correct the StreamerInfo for TArray[I,F] that refrained
 to read a file produced with Rio with jas.

 build :
 -----
  In the source kit, we get rid of the version directory
 under packages. Having them complicate the release procedure.
 But we had keep the versioning tagging logic in the
 repository. The version appearing in the this.obuild file
 of a package is in sync with the tag in the repository.
