  Go in the OpenScientist/<kit>/obuild directory.

  See instruction in the README file found here.

  Note that the <kit>s are today :
  - osc_batch : for building only the "batch" related package. There is
                no GUI and visualization in this build.
                This build is nice to work with AIDA data (for example 
                histograms and tuples) in a batch way ; mainly book, fill 
                and save to files at various formats these AIDA objects.
  - osc_iv : for building the Inventor/Coin related packages.
  - osc_vis : for building the osc_batch packages but also the packages 
              related to GUI, visualization and interactive manipulation
              of AIDA data. It permits to have the osc-plot, onx, opaw
              applications.
