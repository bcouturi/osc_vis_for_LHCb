    Welcome to OpenScientist.

  OpenScientist is an integration of open source products 
 working together to do scientific visualization and data 
 analysis ; in particular for high energy physics (HEP).

  OpenScientist is definitely NOT one million lines of 
 unnecessary complex home made code reinventing everything.
