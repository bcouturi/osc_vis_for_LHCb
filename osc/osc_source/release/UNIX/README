// Working with AIDA :
///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
    
  From a UNIX shell, you can setup the AIDA environment
 with :
    sh> . <install_path>/<pack>/<version>/aida-setup.sh
 ( csh> source <install_path>/<pack>/<version>/aida-setup.csh )

  After having done the aida-setup, you can run aida-config with :
    UNIX> aida-config
    UNIX> aida-config --incs
    UNIX> aida-config --libs
    UNIX> aida-config --version
    UNIX> aida-config --implementation # it should return BatchLab or OnXLab.
    UNIX> aida-config --compiler       # compiler used to build the kit.

// Creating an AIDA application :
///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

  For example let us rebuild the AIDA_example_Histogram program.
      sh> . <install_path>/<pack>/<version>/aida-setup.sh
   ( csh> source <install_path>/<pack>/<version>/aida-setup.csh )
    UNIX> cp "${AIDA_HOME_DIR}"/Resources/AIDA/examples/cpp/slac .
    UNIX> cd slac
    UNIX> ./build Histogram.cpp
    UNIX> ./AIDA_example_Histogram
 In the same way :
    UNIX> ./build Store.cpp
    UNIX> ./AIDA_example_Store
 It should have produced the AIDA_example_Store.aida AIDA-XML data file.

  If having installed an osc-vis kit, the .aida file can be visualized
 with the osc-plot interactive program :
    UNIX> osc-plot
     GUI> File> Open AIDA XML file...> choose AIDA_example_Store.aida
     GUI> Tree> open the AIDA_example_Store.aida tree branch.
     GUI> Tree> clik 'test 1d' or 'test 2d'.
 or by using OpenPAW with :
    UNIX> opaw
     opaw> h/file 10 AIDA_example_Store.aida
     opaw> zone 1 2
     opaw> h/plot 'test 1d'
 OpenPAW in a terminal-like GUI can be started with :
    UNIX> opaw -term

  Note that the installation comes with various data files under the :
   <install_path>/<pack>/<version>/Resources/AIDA/examples/data 
 directory. You can play with them by using osc-plot. For example :
 - open aptuple.tnt with "File/Open hippodraw file (*.tnt)..."
 - open the aptuple.tnt folder in the left browsing tree widget.
 - click the "CERN personnel" tuple ; it should map 
   the "Tuple Explorer" palette.
 - in the "Tuple Explorer" palette "bind X" to "Age"
 - bind Y to "Cost"
 - play with the sliders for X or Y.
 - plot a lego with : Plotter>Shape>Lego
 - play with the sliders for X or Y.

 Some data files are at the hbook format. To be browsed, they will 
 need the BatchLabZebra DLL which may not be available on some 
 platform. About .hbook see the below paragraph about file formats.

///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
// The file formats intrinsic pain :
///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

  .hbook : we definitely advise to avoid the .hbook format which is
 related to software no more supported by the lab that created it (CERN).
 The OpenScientist/BatchLab package can read and write .hbook files but by
 still using the deprecated CERNLIBs. CERN had not been able to do the
 technical followup of this format ; at least pass from F77 to C and
 repack to have a standalone IO package. Be sure that there is no plan 
 in OpenScientist to do this painfull job ; this is a trash that we do not
 want to empty. If wanting to using it, you must be aware that the number of 
 people being able to understand the related code can be probably counted 
 now on one hand.

  .root : people able to understand this format and the IO related code 
 can be counted on two fingers and then we obviously advise to NOT jump 
 into this new engineering CERN trap ; at least for storing such common 
 data than histograms and tuples. The OpenScientist/BatchLab package, by 
 using Rio, can write and read at this format without tying to the 
 "Reinvented Object Orientation Technology" quantum entanglement ; but we 
 are left anyway in the hand of an uncontrolled engineering concerning the 
 specifications of the format and the related code. Able to read your 
 file today, but tomorrow ?

  .aida : the best for the moment is to use the AIDA XML format.
 Compared to the two uppers it is an ocean of limpidity. Moreover it is 
 understood by all the AIDA implementations and if you have an XML 
 package at hand you can easily implement a reader. It will probably cover 
 good part of your needs, with the guarantee of not attaching your
 application to some already outdated software.

  .tnt, .ascii : with OSC/BatchLab you can write a tuple in a file at the 
 simple hippodraw "tnt" ascii format (AIDA::ITree "hippodraw" storage type). 
 The first line of the file is the tuple title, the second is a space 
 separated list of the column labels and the rest of the file are rows 
 of space or tab separated numbers. See data/aptuple.tnt or glast.tnt 
 for examples. Note that in fact you can easily write such a 
 data tuple file even without using AIDA (std::cout or even ::printf can 
 do the job). These files are understood also by the hippodraw (non-AIDA) 
 application, and by removing the two first lines they are also understood 
 by a lot of software (including Mathematica and Excel (and old CERN/PAW)). 

  .hdf5 : the future for big AIDA data files ? The open source IO binary 
 standard that we dream of for so long ?
