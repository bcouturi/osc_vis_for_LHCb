  The installation brings :
 - the onxlab program which is a GUI interactive program to read
   data files at various formats, browse them, plot histograms and 
   functions, manipulate tuples interactively, etc...
 - the opaw program which is the command line emulation of the 
   CERN/PAW program. 
 - the materials to work with AIDA from a DOS prompt. 
   For example the aida-config program, the libraries to create 
   new AIDA applications and some examples.
 - the programs and libraries to build new OnX applications. 

  If creating applications, it is assumed that VisualC++ is installed 
 and accessible from a DOS prompt. That is to say cl.exe, link.exe, etc... 
 are up and running from a DOS prompt. See "Create applications" in the 
 web pages for more.
