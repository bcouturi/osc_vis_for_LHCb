  The osc_vis-darwin-app kit contains some ".app" Mac
 packing for various applications (for exa osc-plot).

  After unziping simply click on the icon of a .app to start 
 the application ! From a terminal you can use also the open command
 to start a .app. For example :
    Darwin> open osc-plot.app

  The .apps are relocatable, you can copy them where
 you want on your disk (for example under /Applications).
