  The update button permits to get the axes values
 of the current plotter.

  In most of the cases axes are automated. That is
 to say the plotter decides axes values according to what
 is plotted. In case multiple objects are plotted, 
 there is one object which is the "master" of the axes.
 In general it is the first plotted object which is 
 the master of the axes.
 
  To enforce min, max values of an axis you must
 not have it automated.
