 The code had been taken from an unfolding of SoQt-1.3.0.tar.gz.

 In general, problems are around :
  gl.h, SoQtBasic.h, soqtdefs.h, config.h.

 In SoQtBasic.h, we have to change the version numbers.

 gl.h, soqtdes.h, config.h are some file guessed 
 and done at the moment of the first CoinQt CMT repacking 
 versions.
